# Visualizing-Matrix-Transformations
This program will visualize linear transformations. Given an image and a 2x2 transformation matrix, the program will animate the transformation on the image. 

Users can choose to display:
- x-y axis
- i-hat and j-hat
- the determinant
- eigenvectors
- grid lines

The above settings can be modified by editing the config.py file.
